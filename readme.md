implementation of a sequence to sequence model using simple rnn's with Tensorflow.

the project contains 3 files:

data_utils.py : contains functions that generate fake data for testing.

model.py : in this file i putted a simple from scratch implementation of rnn.

S2S.py : is the main file when we run the project.
